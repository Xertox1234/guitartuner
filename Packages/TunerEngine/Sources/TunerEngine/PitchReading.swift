/// One precise pitch estimate from the engine — the public output type.
///
/// - `frequency`: estimated fundamental in Hz (sub-cent refined).
/// - `note`: nearest equal-tempered note at the engine's current `a4`.
/// - `cents`: signed offset from `note` (negative = flat), typically −50…+50.
/// - `confidence`: 0…1 periodicity/clarity. Low during the pluck attack and in
///   noise; high on a clean sustain. The sustain gate uses it.
/// - `phase`: the **strobe phase** — a normalized 0…1 cycle position of the
///   tracked fundamental measured against the nearest-note reference oscillator
///   (see `StrobePhase`). On pitch it stands still; off pitch it advances at the
///   beat rate (∝ the frequency error). The strobe scrolls by Δphase between
///   readings — this *is* the true-strobe signal (DESIGN §3, EXPERIENCE §2).
/// - `timestamp`: seconds, monotonic from the engine's audio clock (the time of
///   the analysed window's centre).
/// - `inharmonicityB`: estimated string stiffness coefficient B in the model
///   `fₙ = n·f0·√(1+B·n²)` (Plan 06 §5.3). `nil` for mid/high range readings
///   and while the harmonic fit has not yet converged. Non-nil only when the P2
///   harmonic estimator ran successfully on this reading (bass, f0 < 120 Hz).
